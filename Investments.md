# Investments

Investing is a way to grow your wealth over time by putting money into assets that can increase in value.

### Types of Investments
- **Stocks**: Ownership in a company. Stocks have potential for high returns but come with risk.
- **Bonds**: Loans to corporations or governments that pay interest. Bonds are generally safer but offer lower returns.
- **Real Estate**: Investing in property for rental income or resale value.
